====== PowerPC Emulator Testsuite ======

The PowerPC Emulator Tester is a self-contained testsuite written for the
SheepShaver emulation engine. It was a very handy tool during the development
of the SheepShaver PowerPC Emulator and considerably reduced debugging time when
AltiVec emulation was added. The code is distributed under the terms of the GPL.

It's not terrific code and can largely be improved and cleaned up,
but it provides reasonnable information to chase down a bug.

===== Features =====

  * Self-contained.
    No guest OS nor any complicated run-time environment is required. Your CPU
    emulator simply needs to support a special opcode (''0x18000000'', OP=6)
    that terminates execution of the current basic block.

  * Supports several CPU cores:

  * Supports the AltiVec ISA.

  * Generates more than 2 million tests with specific values to trigger
    condition codes changes, unspecified results (matches a PowerPC 7410,
    aka Powerbook G4).

===== Downloads =====

  * The primary source is available in SheepShaver CVS.

  * It is recommended that you first run the tester on a native PowerPC platform.
    /doc/ contains a sample result file.

===== Usage =====

* Unix platform:
  Change to src/Unix and do the normal ./configure  then make test-powerpc

* Others:
  TODO
