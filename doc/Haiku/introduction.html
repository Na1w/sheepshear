<H1>Introduction</H1>

SheepShaver is a MacOS run-time environment for Haiku that allows you
to run MacOS applications at native speed inside the Haiku multitasking
environment on PowerPC-based Haiku systems. This means that both Haiku
and MacOS applications can run at the same time and data can be exchanged
between them.

<P>SheepShaver is neither a MacOS replacement nor an emulator. It runs an
unmodified PowerPC MacOS under control of the Haiku at full speed without
any kind of emulation. So it also uses the MacOS 68k emulator to run 68k
applications. In this way, SheepShaver is comparable to the "Blue Box" of
Apple's Rhapsody operating system.
