=============================
SheepShear -- A fork of SheepShaver

While SheepShaver provides decent PowerPC emulation
on Linux, BeOS, and Windows, it development has been
extremely slow in the last 5 plus years.

To ensure a quality MacOS Classic emulator continues
on to exist in a functioning state for Linux and Haiku,
SheepShear was created as a fork of the SheepShaver codebase

-----------------------------
Targeted Platforms:
 * Haiku
 * Linux
 * MacOS X
   - MacOS X moved to clang in recent versions. The old qemu
     dyngen engine we use doesn't play nicely with clang :(
 * Windows ?

-----------------------------
TODO Items:
 * Refactor code base, clean up extern functions to classes
 * Better GUI
 * Better Icons
 * Easier to use

-----------------------------
Done Items:
 * Basilisk II code integrated
 * Fork renamed to SheepShear
